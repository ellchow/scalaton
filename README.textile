h2. util

* more generic hashing for basic datatypes and tuples (32 bit, 64 bit, 128 bit)

* path manipulation and filesystem navigation

* monoid instances

* simple csv parse using parser-combinators

h2. collection

_additional collections and enhancements on standard scala collections_

* BiMap - very basic bidirectional map

* External sort

* Immutable Heap (pairing heap implementation)

* Immutable Queue (banker's queue implementation)

* Joins on iterators

* Tee - "tee"-ing an iterator into an output stream

* PlannedIterator - wrapper of iterator that separates composition from consumption of the iterator, allows for easy

* Immutable graph structure for running the topological sort algorithm

* Immutable Trie


h2. aggregate

_aggregation/approximate/streaming algorithms_

* Streaming bootstrap - use poisson approximation to draw a bootstrap estimate from a stream

* FrequentItems - heavy hitters algorithm base on the StreamSummary data structure

* Histogram - online histogram building by bucketization

* Moments - moments aggregation (count, mean, variance, kurtosis, skewness)

* Reservoir Sampling

* Timer - simple timer for calculating average rates

* TopK - maintain the top k items of a stream

* Bloom Filters

* Frequency Sketches - generic sketch structure, with CountMinSketch implementation

* HyperLogLog - approximate cardinality algorithm


h2. async

* Enhancements on Scala Futures (timers/schedulers)
